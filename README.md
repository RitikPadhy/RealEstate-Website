# real-estate-frontend-template

A template for a real estate company made with the help of HTML, TailwindCSS and ReactJS. Our project makes use of the frontend concepts to create a real estate frontend website for a real estate agency. Keep in mind, this was the template used and not the actual website for the agency. We read in data from data.js file which spreads out to different js files in the projects which makes use of this data to be displayed on the UI. We make use of useState, useEffect, createContext to handle data and state among different feature files across the project.
